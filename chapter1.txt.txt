In the quiet village of Elderglen, nestled between mist-shrouded hills and the ancient forest known only in hushed tones as the Whispering Woods, sixteen-year-old Kael stumbled upon a brittle scroll tucked behind a loose stone in his grandmother’s hearth. Ink faded but still legible traced the path through the forbidden trees to something called The Heart of Thorne. No one had dared enter the forest in a generation—stories told of voices that led wanderers astray, never to return. But Kael, restless and curious, felt a pull stronger than fear, as if the map itself was waiting for him.
