In the quiet village of Elderglen, nestled between mist-shrouded hills and the ancient forest known only in hushed tones as the Whispering Woods, sixteen-year-old Kael stumbled upon a brittle scroll tucked behind a loose stone in his grandmother’s hearth. Ink faded but still legible traced the path through the forbidden trees to something called The Heart of Thorne. No one had dared enter the forest in a generation—stories told of voices that led wanderers astray, never to return. But Kael, restless and curious, felt a pull stronger than fear, as if the map itself was waiting for him.





















Elara brushed the dirt from the brittle parchment, her fingers trembling with a mix of fear and excitement. The map, though faded with age, clearly showed a winding trail cutting through the heart of the Whispering Woods, ending at a spot marked with a crimson “X” near the symbol of a crescent moon. Scribbled along the edge in a spidery hand were the words: "What was lost shall be found where silence speaks the loudest." She studied the path, trying to match the hand-drawn landmarks with what she knew of the woods—ancient oaks, a fallen tower, the stream known as Mourner’s Run. This wasn’t just a relic; it was a guide, perhaps even a summons.

With the map clutched tightly in her cloak, Elara stood and glanced toward the looming treeline, where the late afternoon sun cast long, reaching shadows. The elders always warned the villagers to stay away from the forest after dusk, claiming the woods whispered secrets that weren’t meant for human ears. But Elara’s curiosity burned brighter than her fear. She packed a satchel with essentials—a flask, a lantern, her mother’s dagger—and crossed the boundary stone before hesitation could catch up with her. The trees seemed to shift subtly as she entered, as if the forest was acknowledging her choice. Somewhere in the depths ahead, the truth waited.
