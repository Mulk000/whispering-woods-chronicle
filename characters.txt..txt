Elara is a bright-eyed, sixteen-year-old villager with tangled chestnut hair and a dusting of freckles across her nose. Small but quick, she’s known for climbing rooftops and sneaking into the forest edge. Her boundless curiosity often lands her in trouble—and it’s exactly what led her to the mysterious map.
Shadow is a black wolf with silver eyes and a silent, watchful presence. Rescued by Elara as a pup, he became her steadfast guardian. Agile and alert, he senses danger before it nears. Loyal to the core, Shadow never leaves her side, even when the forest grows dark and strange.
